    <h1>About this project:</h1>
    <p>This project was an independant programming project to create
      a functioning and secure login system and learn more about vue.js. The purpose of the website 
      is to pull data from the Google Places API based on what type of restaurant
      you are in the mood for. Users of this website can 'star' restaurants to save
      in their profile to view later.
